  ## Installation 
I started with a gitignore file, then I installed inquire to create the prompts, jest to allow for testing, SVG files to create the colors, shapes and text colors, and then I wrote the index.js file to execute the code.

  ## Usage 
First, you want to test it. You do this by pulling up the terminal and typing npm run test. Then you type node index.js and fill out the prompt. Once you've completed the prompt, an SVG file will be created.
